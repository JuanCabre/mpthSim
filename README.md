# MTPTH-Sim

This repository contains both a simulator and a library to simulate network
coded multipath transmissions. The goal is to simulate earth-earth and
aircraft-earth communications over GEO and LEO satellites, and HAPS (high
altitude platform system).

## Components

The components of the library are:

*Links: A link is represented by an input and output channel, a paket error rate
probability, and a delay.

*Nodes

*Paths
